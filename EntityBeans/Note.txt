Mapping of persistance.xml file with session beans.

For JBoss,
Put the -ds file (database config file) in the server\default\deploy folder.
the Jndi name should be the same as the datasource name in the persistance.xml file. 

Deploy the ear file in the application server and start the server.
Check logs of AS for any problems in deployment of the beans. 


In this example : oracledb-ds.xml file in jboss deploy folder
