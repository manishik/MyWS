My GIT Notes


Get the changes from one folder to another. 
1 - fetch from origin
2 - local merge


After making changes to a file in a location, it has to be committed. 

From another location/folder, 
Add a location in remote by doing remote-add
Then do a local merge. Resolve merge issues if any.
