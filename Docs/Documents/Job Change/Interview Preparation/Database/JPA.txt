JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification of how the object relational mapping should be done. 
Java is an object oriented programming language. 
Data from java objects need to be stored in relational (sql based) tables. 
JPA defines the specification (interface) of how the mapping should be done. 
JPA is just a specification with no implementation. 

Hibernate is an implementation of the JPA specification.
All annotations specified by JPA are implemented by Hibernate.

The main benefit of using JPA is that at a later point in time, you can easily switch to another implementation of JPA (different from Hibernate). 
If I directly use Hibernate annotations, I'm locked in to Hibernate. I cannot easily switch to another ORM framework.
