The Benefits of NoSQL
and their data model addresses several issues that the relational model is not designed to address

Large volumes of rapidly changing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
Agile sprints, quick schema iteration, and frequent code pushes
Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible
Geographically distributed scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture

NoSQL databases are built to allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema.	

MongoDB
No Joins and No transaction support

MongoDB does not support multi-document transactions. However, MongoDB does provide atomic operations on a single document.

No Schema (No predefined schemas) - schemaless dbs
more scalable
Faster than RDBMS (superior performance)
JSON objects



BSON - Binary JSON
BSON documents (objects) consist of an ordered list of elements. 
BSON types are nominally a superset of JSON types (JSON does not have a date or a byte array type)
